This repository contains resources for building the official HedgeDoc containers published to quay.io.

## Getting Started

Have a look at our [getting started guide](https://docs.hedgedoc.org/setup/getting-started/) and follow the instructions 
for Docker.

They are maintained in the [main HedgeDoc repository](https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/blob/master/docs/content/setup/docker.md),
so PRs must be filed over there.
